## About

> I primarily started my web development journey as a Drupal Developer around 5 years back. And I still love working on it.
I love working with JavaScript and like to stay upto date with current trends and new tech on the scene. I like problem solving, debugging, writing optimised code,
evolving and adapting to future ready technologies.
I do believe that every day, every project, every hour is a new learning experience.
Each and every problem can be turned into a viable solution.
One Day at a time.
